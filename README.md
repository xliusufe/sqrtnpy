# sqrtnpy
A Python pacakge to calculate `sqrt(n)` with very high precision. "sqrtn"" implements dramatically fast. It takes only less than 30 seconds to approximate square root of 2 with `100,000` digits. Function `sqrtn2()` can approximate square root of `n` for any positive integer. The last two or three digits may be incorrect. For seek of safety, it is better to input two or three more to guarantee precision.

# Installation

    pip install git+https://github.com/xliusufe/sqrtnpy.git

# Usage
- Syntax: `sqrtn(n,prec)`
    - Input:
        - `n`: a natural number 
        - `prec`: The a positive integer, which is the precision you want.

    - Output: the square root of `n`, which is a string.

- An R package named [sqrtn](https://github.com/xliusufe/sqrtn/) can be found on github.
   
# Example 1

    from sqrtn import sqrtn

    fit = sqrtn(2, 100)
